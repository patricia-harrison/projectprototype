This project is related to mine because it introduced a form of randomised speech for the microbit to produce. The desired outcome for my project is to have a random line of text picked and readout to the user.

Microbit Controlled Radio

This project is related to mine because it allows the user to controll the volume and radio channel which is ___ live via the internet. The goal for my project is not to 'live stream' audio from the internet, but audio files from the microbit or an attached micro ssd card.

This project is related to mine because it involves the use of mp3 files and an LCD screen, which are both elements that I want to implement perminently into the final project.

This project is related to mine because involves the use of mp3 files which are triggared to play at the press of a button. This system of interaction is exactly what I wish to do. However, the piece of hardware this related projuct uses can only hold a few seconds of audio, which is an issue.

DIY Cozmo Robot Expressions

https://www.instructables.com/id/DIY-Cozmo-Robot/



This project is related to mine because it is based entirely around cute expressions which are shown to the user via an LED screen. The expressions shown in this related project are based on the Anki robot, Cozmo, which happen to be similar to the expressions I wish to produce for my project.

## Other research ##
All of the related projects shown above have been the most helpful in the development of my ideas, how I will produce my desired product and have event influenced the external design of my project plan. 

*Include here any other relevant research you have done. This might include identifying readings, tutorials, videos, technical documents, or other resources that have been helpful. For each particular source, add a comment or two about why it is relevant or what you have taken from it.*

### *Brief resource name/description* ###

*Provide a link, reference, or whatever is required for somebody else to find the resource. Then provide a few comments about what you have drawn from the resource.*

## Conceptual progress ##

### Design intent ###

An affirmations desk 'toy' which will keep users company and remind them to look after themselves.

### Design concept 1 ###
A box-like robot that makes unintelligable cute sounds in response to a button being pressed. It is essentially a tamagochi that you don't need to feed.  

*Outline three design concepts, each developed to a point where you anticipate it would be feasible to complete by the end of the course. Each should have a summary of the idea, a rough sketch of what it might be like, and any other notes you created while exploring the idea.* 

*Put the first two design concepts in the sections "Design concept 1" and "Design concept 2". Then put the third, with more development in the section "Final design concept".*

### Design concept 2 ###


### Final design concept ###
The initial idea for this project was to create some sort of interactive desk “toy” or device that would act as a type of “companion”, in a sense. This idea had been sparked from a few different things - the companion cube from the game Portal, Cozmo and Vector robots made by Anki, tamagochi and the screaming roomba which was hacked by the YouTuber Michael Reeves. These pieces of inspiration combined into the idea for a wholesome desk robot companion which would provide the user with affirmations, kind words and reminders to stay hydrated and to look after themselves. The intended purpose for this device is to act as a ‘friend’ of sorts for those who spend a lot of time working at their desk and often forget to take breaks. It could also help ease anxiety, intrusive thoughts and lowered self esteem through its kind and cute demeanor. The intended physical interaction between the robot and the user is to be kept simple, so that anyone can use it. The interaction will preferably occur through a button on the top or “face” of the robot (the side of the box with a small LED screen, in which the robot will show expressions). 

A possible name for the companion robot “Hako” (はこ) which means box/case/crate in japanese. I thought this name was cute, short and fitting, considering that this robot companion will essentially be a little talking cubed companion that sits on the usered desk.
The expressions have been influenced by both of the Anki robots (Vector and Cozmo) and cute japanese emoticons. 
The design of the box will preferably be kept simple and clean. Hence the cube shape and simple interactions the user can experience (the press of a button which triggers the scripted lines and the expressioned the user can see via the LED screen on the front side of the robot.)

## Physical experimentation documentation ##

*In this section, show your progress including whichever of the following are appropriate for your project at this point.
a.	Technical development. Could be code screenshots, pictures of electronics and hardware testing, video of tests. 
b.	Fabrication. Physical models, rough prototypes, sketches, diagrams of form, material considerations, mood boards, etc.
Ensure you include comments about the choices you've made along the way.*

*You will probably have a range of images and screenshots. Any test videos should be uploaded to YouTube or other publicly accessible site and a link provided here.*

## Design process discussion ##

To get to this point in the project required a lot of searching and rummaging around the internet for similar projects, products and code. 
The start of this project consisted entirely of brainstorming a product that would:
- aid with mental health
- encourage users to look after themselves (e.g. stay hydrated)
- provide affirmations to the user and provide wholesome encouragement 
- to be placed on desks in offices/bedrooms 
Essentially, the initial idea for this product came from the desire I had for a cute, encouraging desk 'companion'. I knew that for me, something like this little robot would be very helpful for when I am struggling with anxiety, self-esteem issues and intrusive thoughts. Sometimes all I need is something small to cheer me up, e.g. getting a cute meme from a friend could instantly snap me out of that mood. Thus I believe a little robot that provide wholesome affirmations and reminders at the press of the button could not only help myself, but possible others who feel the same. 

## Next steps ##

- purchase any materials needed to continue forward in the project.
- experiment with triggering expressions and audio
- decide on whether to record scripted lines or keep the robotic and slightly distorted voice.
- Once decided, begin the creation of the external 'shell' for the robot. 
- ensure all circutry fits within the confines of the 'shell'
- ensure the 'shell' is aesthetically pleasing and simple. 
- Finalise code and test the product
- trial the product on family and note down their feedback.
- if possible, implement the feedback into the project. 
- Document.
